Question:
In a Linux environment, you have five directories named old1, old2, old3, old4, and new1. 
You're uncertain which directory is the most recently created. 
How would you navigate to the second-to-last created directory using a single command in the terminal?

cd "$(ls -lt | grep '^d' | awk 'NR==2 {print $NF}')"
