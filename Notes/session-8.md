1. **Shell Expansion:**

- **Explanation:** Shell expansion refers to the process by which the shell expands certain patterns, variables, and special characters before executing a command. This expansion can involve wildcard matching, variable substitution, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
- **Examples:**
  - Wildcard Matching: `ls *.txt` matches all files with a `.txt` extension.
  - Variable Substitution: `$HOME` expands to the user's home directory.
  - Command Substitution: `$(command)` executes `command` and substitutes its output.
  - Arithmetic Expansion: `$((2 + 2))` evaluates to `4`.
  - echo $(cat Documents/cal.txt)
  - echo $(ls)

2. **Different Types of Shells:**

- **Bash (Bourne Again SHell):** One of the most widely used shells, known for its scripting capabilities and compatibility with Bourne shell syntax. Default shell on many Unix-like systems.
- **Ksh (KornShell):** Developed by David Korn at AT&T Bell Labs, it offers powerful scripting features similar to Bash but with some differences in syntax and behavior.
- **Zsh (Z Shell):** Known for its advanced features, extensive customization options, and improved tab completion. Increasingly popular among power users for its flexibility and modern feel.

3. **Shell Built-In Commands and External Commands:**

- **Shell Built-In Commands:** These are commands that are implemented within the shell itself and do not require invoking external programs. They are usually faster and more efficient than external commands because they execute directly within the shell's process.
  - **Examples:** `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `alias`, `history`.
- **External Commands:** These are standalone executable files or programs located in the system's executable paths. When you run an external command, the shell searches for it in directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable and executes it as a separate process.
  - **Examples:** `ls`, `grep`, `cat`, `rm`, `chmod`.

**Difference:**

- Shell built-in commands are part of the shell itself, while external commands are separate programs.
- Built-in commands execute directly within the shell process, while external commands are executed as separate processes.
- Built-in commands are typically faster and more efficient, whereas external commands may incur additional overhead due to process creation.

Certainly! Here's an explanation of each command along with examples:

1. **`echo $SHELL`:**

   - **Description:** Prints the path to the current shell executable.
   - **Example:** `echo $SHELL` might output `/bin/bash` if you're using Bash as your shell.

2. **`echo $HOSTNAME`:**

   - **Description:** Prints the hostname of the system.
   - **Example:** `echo $HOSTNAME` might output `my-computer` if that's your system's hostname.

3. **`echo -e "James \nBond"`:**

   - **Description:** The -e option enables interpretation of backslash escapes in the provided string. Backslash escapes are sequences of characters that represent special characters. For example, \n represents a newline character, \t represents a tab character, etc.

   - **Common Backslash Escapes:**

   1. \n: Newline
   2. \t: Tab
   3. \\: Backslash
   4. \": Double quote
   5. \b: Backspace
   6. \r: Carriage return
   7. \v: Vertical tab

4. **`lsblk` vs `/usr/bin/lsblk`:**

   - **Description:** `lsblk` is a command to list information about all available block devices. `/usr/bin/lsblk` specifies the full path to the `lsblk` executable.
   - **Example:** Running `lsblk` or `/usr/bin/lsblk` would display information about block devices like disks and partitions.

5. **`alias`:**

   - **Description:** Allows you to create shortcuts (aliases) for commands or command sequences.
   - **Example:** `alias ll='ls -l'` creates an alias `ll` for `ls -l`, so `ll` will now list files in long format.

6. **`unalias`:**

   - **Description:** Removes an alias previously defined with the `alias` command.
   - **Example:** `unalias ll` would remove the `ll` alias defined in the previous example.

7. **`type <CMD name>`:**

   - **Description:** Displays information about the type of a command (whether it's a shell built-in, alias, function, or external command).
   - **Example:** `type ls` would output `ls is /bin/ls`, indicating that `ls` is an external command located at `/bin/ls`.

   - `builtin`: Refers to a command that is built into the shell itself.
   - `alias`: Refers to a user-defined shortcut for a command or command sequence.
   - `function`: Refers to a user-defined shell function.
   - `file`: Refers to an external command, i.e., an executable file located in one of the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.

8. **How to set alias permanently:**
   - **Description:** To set an alias permanently, add the `alias` command to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` for Bash or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh).
   - **Example:** Add `alias ll='ls -l'` to `~/.bashrc` to make the `ll` alias available every time you start a new Bash session.

## By understanding and utilizing these commands effectively, you can enhance your productivity and efficiency when working with the Linux command line.

To set an alias permanently, you need to add it to your shell configuration file. Here's a step-by-step process:

1. **Identify Your Shell:**
   Determine which shell you are using. Common shells include Bash, Zsh, and others.

2. **Locate Your Shell Configuration File:**

   - For Bash: The shell configuration file is usually `~/.bashrc`.
   - For Zsh: The shell configuration file is usually `~/.zshrc`.
   - Note: If you're using a different shell, the configuration file name may vary.

3. **Open the Configuration File in a Text Editor:**
   Use a text editor to open your shell configuration file. For example:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc   # For Bash
   ```

   Or:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc    # For Zsh
   ```

4. **Add Your Alias to the File:**
   Scroll to the end of the file or any suitable location, and add your alias in the following format:

   ```bash
   alias alias_name='command or command sequence'
   ```

   Replace `alias_name` with your desired alias name and `command or command sequence` with the command or commands you want the alias to execute.

5. **Save and Exit the Editor:**
   Save the changes you made in the text editor and exit.

6. **Reload the Shell Configuration:**
   To apply the changes to your current shell session, you can either close and reopen your terminal or use the `source` command to reload the shell configuration file:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc   # For Bash
   ```

   Or:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc    # For Zsh
   ```

7. **Verify Your Alias:**
   After reloading the shell configuration, you can verify that your alias is set by typing:
   ```bash
   alias
   ```
   This will list all defined aliases, including the one you just added.

Your alias should now be set permanently and available in all future shell sessions. You can repeat these steps to add additional aliases as needed.
